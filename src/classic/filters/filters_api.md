# Filters Through API

Once a filter is [defined and saved](/filters/saving_sharing_filters) via the web UI, the filter is made available via the [API](/api/mh_rest_api). Clients can leverage the API to get list of filters and then use any of them and query matching issues.

In addition, the API exposes a set of standard out-of-the-box filters like “Reported by Me”, “Assigned to Me”, “Unassigned”, “Monitored by Me”.

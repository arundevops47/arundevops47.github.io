# Our Company Does Not Have a Credit Card

In some cases companies don't have a payment method that can be used to setup MantisHub.  Here are the options for such cases:

- You can use a personal credit card and expense it. This is common for companies that don't have a corporate credit card. However, often companies that go that route elect for annual plan for less paperwork.
- We support an [invoice billing service](/plans_billing/invoice) for customer on annual platinum plans with an added surcharge.

All billing invoices and statements will still display the account owner name and details. Full statements emailed at period end will contain transaction details including the last 4 digits of the CC charged. However, the name on the CC will NOT be displayed.

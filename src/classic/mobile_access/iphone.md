# Mobile Access on iPhone

Here are the steps to add a home screen icon, similar to the ones for native apps:

- Go to Settings, Safari, and set “Accept Cookies” to “Always”.
- Open Safari and browse to `https://foo.mantishub.com/` (with foo being the instance name)
- Click the “share” arrow button and click “Add to Home Screen”, then confirm “MantisHub” name.
- Close Safari and run the [responsive mobile UI](/mobile_access/accessing_mh) from the home page icon.

To save your login details for mobile access go to Settings, Safari, Passwords and add the site URL (/m at the end), username and password. This will auto populate the username and password.

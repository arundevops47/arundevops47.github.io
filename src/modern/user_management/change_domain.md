# Changing MantisHub URL/Domain Name

MantisHub does support changing your MantisHub domain name (e.g. from greatsoftware.mantishub.io to fantasticsoftware.mantishub.io). If you wish move forward with changing your URL/domain name have your account owner or an administrator [contact our support team](/user_management/contact_support) with the new name. We'll confirm if your new name is available and change it over for you!

Please note: Changing your URL/domain name in the billing portal will NOT automatically update your URL. You will still need to contact support to apply this change. 

However, there are a few things to consider before making this change, particularly if you have already been using MantisHub for some time. Links to your existing MantisHub URL will not automatically be redirected to the new URL. The following links will break after the change is complete:

Links within issue email notifications sent prior to the change.
Links within reset password or new user emails sent prior to the change.
Browser Bookmarks to the old MantisHub URL that have been saved by users.
Additionally, if you have set up email forwarding of your organization's support email address to your MantisHub Helpdesk address, this will also need to be updated by your email provider/IT support to the new address.

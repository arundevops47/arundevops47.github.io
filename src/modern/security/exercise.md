# How to Exercise your GDPR Rights

MantisHub is committed protecting and securing data for all our customers including compliance with [General Data Protection Regulation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Data_Protection_Regulation) and the rights as listed for EU citizens in these data privacy and protection laws.

For security process related queries, refer to our [security FAQ article here](/security/mantishub).

**GDPR Overview**

Under GDPR, EU data subjects are entitled to exercise the following rights:

- **Right of Access**: Find out what kind of personal information is held about you and get a copy of this information.
- **Right of Rectification**: Ask for your information to be updated or corrected.
- **Right to Data Portability**: Receive a copy of the information which you have provided under contract so that you can provide that information to another organization. 
- **Right to Restrict Use**: Ask for your personal information to stop being used in certain cases, including if you believe that the personal information about you is incorrect or the use is unlawful.
- **Right to Object**: Objecting to use of your information (where a party is processing it on legitimate interest basis) and to have your personal information deleted.
- **Right to Erasure**: In certain circumstances, you may also have your personal information deleted.

**Roles**

**Data controllers** determine how personal data is processed, **data processors** process personal data on behalf of a data controller, and **data subjects** are persons whose personal data is collected or used.

Data controllers within or outside of the EU are required to respond to requests from EU data subjects who ask to exercise their GDPR rights.

- Account Administrators are data controllers of the issue or user data they collect, while MantisHub is the data processor of this data.
- MantisHub is a data controller of very limited data about account users — we may use things like cookie data and IP address for specific purposes as described in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.mantishub.com/privacy-policy).
- For data subjects like account administrators, MantisHub is the data controller of personal data like name, email address, and digital identifiers like a cookie ID or IP address, among other things. We describe in detail the data we collect and how we use it in our [Privacy Policy](https://www.mantishub.com/privacy-policy).

**Account Administrators**

**Managing Your Personal Data**

Account administrators can be either individual subscriber or organizations who own a MantisHub account with multiple users. MantisHub account administrators can view, edit, & delete their personal data directly.

These articles can help you manage your personal data:

- [Change account password](/user_management/change_password)
- [Delete your account](/plans_billing/closing)
- [Accessing billing Information](/user_management/login_billing)
- [Updating contact details](/plans_billing/updating)
- [Transferring account ownership](/plans_billing/transfer)

**Managing Issue & User Data**

Account administrators are required to respond to requests from EU data subjects who ask to exercise their GDPR rights. As a data processor, MantisHub is not responsible for handling these requests on behalf of account administrators.

These articles can help you manage data:

- [User management](/user_management/restricting_issue_access)
- [Issue management](/issue_management/auto_complete)
- [Backing Up and Downloading your Data](/import_export/backingup)

**Account Users**

Account users is an umbrella term for any user who have access to a given MantisHub account. This includes, but not limited to, issue reporters, developers, project managers ...etc. You should contact the account administrator who is responsible for editing, deleting, or giving you a copy of your data.

If you’re unable to get in touch with the account administrator, please try to track down the following information before [contacting us](/user_management/contact_support):

- Account URL address or email invitation to join the account
- Your account username and email address
- Any ID of an issue reported or commented on

Since MantisHub is not the data controller of issue or account user data, we can't directly handle these requests, but we'll do our best to identify and put you in contact with the account administrator.

Trial Accounts (i.e. non-paid accounts) and cancelled accounts are auto delete and all user and issue data is irreversibly lost after a grace period of 30 days from the trial expiration date. Administrators of trial accounts can request immediate deletion of their data if they wish by [contacting us](/user_management/contact_support).

**Site Visitors**

A site visitor can be anyone that visits the MantisHub webpage. Site visitors can delete personal data we might have stored about them at anytime by [clearing cookies](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/32050?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en). Trial users and Subscribers can contact us to request permanent data deletion.

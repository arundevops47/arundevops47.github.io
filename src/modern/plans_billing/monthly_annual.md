# Monthly vs. Annual Plans

For even better value on our already low pricing, MantisHub offers **Annual Plans**.

For each of our month to month plan options Gold, Platinum or our bulk user plans, you can choose to move to an annual plan with a discounted rate and the convenience of a single statement per year.

Check out our [pricing page](https://www.mantishub.com/pricing) for details. You can toggle between annual and monthly pricing to compare. You can also enter your expected user numbers into our [pricing calculator](https://www.mantishub.com/pricing#calculator) to determine the most cost-effective annual plan for your needs.

For example, the annual plan rate for Gold and Platinum provides around **25% discount** on the monthly pricing and locks that pricing in for 12months! This is a significant saving so well worth considering. 

[User and Storage pack](/plans_billing/storage) add-ons are also charged at the discounted rate when you move to annual. We check your MantisHub once a month for any extra add-ons. We then pro-rate the charge until your next renewal and apply it to your registered payment method. See our [Storage & User packs](/plans_billing/storage) article for details. 

You can [switch your plan over](/plans_billing/switching) at anytime by accessing your [billing portal interface](/user_management/login_billing) via the 'Billing' tab in your MantisHub. And we provide a 30-day money-back guarantee on all purchases!

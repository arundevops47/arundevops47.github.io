# Email Reporting and Spam

Now that we have opened up the ability to [report issues](/mantishub_helpdesk/report_email) and [issue notes](/mantishub_helpdesk/comment_issues) via email, it is expected to have concerns about spam.  There are several approaches to how you can protect your tracker against spam.

- **Anti-spam** - all emails go through anti-spam before being considered for addition as issues.  Hence, if there is an email that is caught by anti-spam, you won't be getting it.
- **Restricting sender address** - If you don't really need anyone on the internet to submit issues via email, then restrict submission to users who have MantisHub accounts (i.e. their email address is associated with a registered user).
- **Inbox Project** - Create a project that just acts as a landing place for issues that can be triaged and then moved to the appropriate project.  This reduces the number of people who may be spammed if a spam issue is created.

No spam filter is perfect, so if an issue is created that is spam, users can delete it.

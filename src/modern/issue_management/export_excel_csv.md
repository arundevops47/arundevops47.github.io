# Export Issues to Excel / CSV

Following are the steps to export issues to CSV or Excel file:

- Go to View Issues page
- Adjust the filter based on what you need.  Issues that are matching your current filter are the ones that will be exported.
- Click "Excel Export" or "CSV Export" and save file
- Open Excel and open the file from its downloaded location - double clicking on the file may not work.

If you want to select fields that are included in the export, you can use the column configuration for that: [Columns in View Issues, CSV Export and Excel Export](/customizations/column_views).

# Enabling Managers to Create Projects

By default 'managers' can amend project settings but cannot create them. You can change this by creating a configuration option via the “Manage - Manage Configuration - Configuration Report” page. Select "Create Configuration Option" and enter the following settings:

**Username**: All Users

**Project Name**: All Projects

**Configuration Option**: create_project_threshold

**Type**: integer

**Value**: 70

`All Projects, All Users, create_project_threshold, integer, 70`
